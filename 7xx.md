# Introduction

Some words and stuff. Reference to [@?RFC7231], looking to classify 500 series as unknown unknowns, and the 700 series as known unknowns.

## Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**,
**SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, when they appear in this
document, are to be interpreted as described in [@?RFC2119].
